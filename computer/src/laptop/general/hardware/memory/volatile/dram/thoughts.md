The ontology of DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) provides a structured conceptualization of its components, relationships, and characteristics. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of DRAMâ€™s ontology categorized into key domains:

â¸»

ðŸ”· 1. Class: DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory)
	â€¢	Definition: A type of volatile memory that stores each bit of data in a separate capacitor within an integrated circuit.

â¸»

ðŸ”· 2. Subclasses / Components
	â€¢	Cell: Basic unit consisting of a transistor and capacitor.
	â€¢	Array: 2D grid of cells.
	â€¢	Bank: A block of arrays that can operate independently.
	â€¢	Rank: Group of chips working together.
	â€¢	Module: A physical unit (e.g., DIMM).
	â€¢	Controller: Manages access to the DRAM (e.g., memory controller in CPU).

â¸»

ðŸ”· 3. Properties
	â€¢	Volatility: Data is lost when power is removed.
	â€¢	Latency: Delay in accessing memory (CAS latency, RAS to CAS).
	â€¢	Bandwidth: Data transfer rate (measured in MB/s or GB/s).
	â€¢	Refresh Requirement: Periodic refreshing to maintain data.
	â€¢	Capacity: Total amount of data that can be stored.
	â€¢	Speed: Measured in MHz or MT/s.

ðŸ”· 4. Types (Subclasses of DRAM)
	â€¢	SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM): Synchronized with the system bus.
	â€¢	DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate SDRAM):
	â€¢	DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, DDR5: Increasing speeds and efficiencies.
	â€¢	LPDDR (Low Power DDR): Used in mobile devices.
	â€¢	EDO DRAM, FPM DRAM: Older types with different access mechanisms.

ðŸ”· 5. Relationships
	â€¢	DRAM has part â†’ Cell
	â€¢	Array is part of â†’ Bank
	â€¢	Bank is part of â†’ Rank
	â€¢	Rank is part of â†’ Module
	â€¢	Module connects to â†’ Motherboard
	â€¢	Controller controls access to â†’ DRAM

â¸»

ðŸ”· 6. Functions
	â€¢	Read Operation: Fetching data from memory.
	â€¢	Write Operation: Storing data into memory.
	â€¢	Refresh Operation: Recharging capacitors to prevent data loss.

â¸»

ðŸ”· 7. Applications
	â€¢	Computers: Primary memory in desktops/laptops.
	â€¢	Servers: High-capacity, ECC (error-correcting) DRAM modules.
	â€¢	Mobile Devices: LPDDR variants.
	â€¢	Embedded Systems: DRAM for real-time data access.
