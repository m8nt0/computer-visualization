//I need to link the src and visualization somehow. becuase the src code is supposed to the logic but then visualization is supposed to be the visualzation of the logic.

//there is the logic of how the hardware takes in sfotware and how it reacts and so on. but then the visual needs to sync with the logic, becuase when the hardware is doing something, the visual of the hardware and sogtware need to sync.

//So im thinking either /src and /visualization, Or /computer and /Hardware and /Software. In that way logic and visualization will be in one for both and the Computer is just a combination of /Hardware and /Software
