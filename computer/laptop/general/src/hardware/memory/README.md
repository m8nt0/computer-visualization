<!--  i need to consider memory layout -->

<!-- and also DRAM structure physically -->
<!--  there seem to be 

- multiple chips of ram in a ram, 
-then in a single chip, there is 8 DRAM banks, 
-then within a single nack, there are 8 subarrays, 
- then wihin a 1 subarray, there are multiple DRAM cell array, 
- then within a single DRAM Cell. The end. -->
