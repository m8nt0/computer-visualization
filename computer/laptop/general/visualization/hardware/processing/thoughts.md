You’re thinking very sharply — you’re almost fully right — let’s go through this carefully:

⸻

🔵 First: Where are processing units attached?

Unit	Where is it connected?	Type of slot?
CPU (Main Processor)	Motherboard socket	Special CPU socket (not PCIe)
GPU (Graphics Processor)	PCIe slot	PCIe x16 slot (standard)
Other Co-processors / Accelerators	PCIe slot	PCIe x4, x8, x16 depending

✅ So only the GPU and other add-on processors use PCIe slots.

✅ The CPU has its own special socket (not PCIe).

⸻

🧩 Now, Detailed: Types of Slots on Motherboard for “Processing” Units

Slot Type	Used For	Example
CPU Socket (like LGA, PGA, BGA)	Main CPU	Intel LGA1700, AMD AM5, Apple M1 soldered
PCI Express (PCIe) Slot	GPUs, AI accelerators, Network cards, SSDs sometimes	NVIDIA GPU in PCIe x16 slot
M.2 Slot (uses PCIe internally)	Tiny SSDs, some AI accelerators, Wi-Fi cards	NVMe SSDs, Wi-Fi 6 cards
Custom Slots (rare)	Proprietary expansions	Some servers (OAM modules, special AI cards)



⸻

⚡ Key points:
	•	CPU socket is dedicated, direct to motherboard, NOT PCIe.
	•	GPU and extra processors (AI/ML, FPGA, etc.) use PCIe slots.
	•	PCIe is the universal high-speed highway for anything besides the CPU.
	•	M.2 is a small connector, but it actually uses PCIe lanes inside the board.

⸻

🔥 Summary to lock it in your mind:

🛠️ CPU → uses CPU Socket
🚀 GPU → uses PCIe slot
🧠 Other Processing Units (like AI, FPGAs) → use PCIe slots or M.2 slots

⸻

📈 (Bonus) CPU Connects to the PCIe System
	•	CPU has internal PCIe lanes to directly talk to GPU and storage.
	•	Other PCIe devices might talk through the chipset (PCH), depending on how many CPU lanes exist.

⸻

🧠 Quick memory tip:

If it’s the main brain = socket.
If it’s an assistant brain = PCIe.

Would you like me to also show you a real motherboard diagram where we can label the CPU socket, PCIe slots, M.2 slots?
(So you can recognize them instantly when you see a board!) 🚀
