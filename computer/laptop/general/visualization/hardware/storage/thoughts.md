// Storage (SSD/HDD)

// M.2 packaged SSD (small card) or STAT 2.5 packaged drive

// SATA are slower than NVMe supposdly, but M.2 on the other hand, is actually a type of form factor.


//üîµ About the M.2 Slot and Buses:

üî• M.2 is just a physical slot ‚Äî it can be wired internally to either:
	‚Ä¢	PCIe bus (for super fast NVMe SSDs)
	‚Ä¢	OR SATA bus (for regular SATA SSDs)
	‚Ä¢	OR both (some motherboards can detect either automatically).

Slot Name: M.2 (NVMe)
Bus Type Used: PCIe (and uses NVMe protocol)
Form Factor: M.2 2280 (common)
Notes: Very fast. Modern laptops use this for main storage.

Slot Name: M.2 (SATA)
Bus Type Used: SATA
Form Factor: M.2 2280 (same slot!)
Notes: Same physical M.2 slot, but uses SATA (slower than PCIe).

Slot Name: SATA (2.5√¢‚Ç¨¬ù drive bay)
Bus Type: SATA
Form Factor: 2.5-inch drive (HDD or SSD)
Notes: Older style. Many laptops used to have space for this.

Slot Name: PCIe BGA soldered storage (UFS)
Bus Type: PCIe
Form Factor: No slot (chip soldered)
Notes: In super-thin laptops, SSD is soldered directly onto motherboard.

Slot Name: mSATA (very old)
Bus Type: SATA
Form Factor: Mini PCIe slot form factor
Notes: Used in old laptops (~2010√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú2015). Replaced by M.2.

Slot Name: eMMC (cheap laptops/tablets)
Bus Type: Custom bus (MMC protocol)
Form Factor: Soldered chip
Notes: Very slow. Found in budget devices, Chromebooks.


//1. M.2 slot
	‚Ä¢	Very common in modern Windows laptops.
	‚Ä¢	It looks like a tiny rectangular slot with a single screw mount.
	‚Ä¢	Supports:
	‚Ä¢	NVMe drives (over PCIe bus) ‚Äî super fast.
	‚Ä¢	SATA drives (over SATA bus) ‚Äî slower, legacy option.
	‚Ä¢	Connector: Edge connector (gold fingers).

Important: M.2 is a form factor (physical size). It can use either PCIe or SATA for communication.
(Just depends on what M.2 drive you buy.)

‚úÖ 2. SATA slot (2.5‚Äù Drive Bay)
	‚Ä¢	Older or cheaper laptops still have a 2.5‚Äù bay.
	‚Ä¢	Fits:
	‚Ä¢	SATA SSD (solid state drive) or
	‚Ä¢	SATA HDD (spinning hard drive).
	‚Ä¢	Slower (about 500 MB/s max).
	‚Ä¢	Connector: SATA data + power connector.

‚úÖ 3. Proprietary Slots (Apple, some ultrabooks)
	‚Ä¢	MacBooks (especially older Intel ones like 2013‚Äì2015) used a custom Apple SSD connector.
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs based on PCIe but physically different ‚Äî not standard M.2.
	‚Ä¢	Newer Apple Silicon MacBooks (M1, M2, M3) ‚Üí SSD is soldered directly to the motherboard (‚ö° no slot at all!).
