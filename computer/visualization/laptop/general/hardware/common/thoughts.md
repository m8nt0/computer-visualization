üçé MacBooks Specific (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3 MacBooks)
	‚Ä¢	CPU + GPU + RAM + Neural Engine + Storage controller are all inside one giant chip (SoC = System on Chip).
	‚Ä¢	ZERO slots for processing units. Not even SO-DIMM memory slots.
	‚Ä¢	Everything is soldered inside a single M-series SoC chip.

Example:
	‚Ä¢	M1 has CPU cores, GPU cores, Neural Engine, RAM, all inside one packaged chip.
	‚Ä¢	Storage (SSD) is still separate NAND chips soldered directly to the board.
