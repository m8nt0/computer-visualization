//The type of packaging that is usually used for GPU is BGA (Ball Grid Array), soldered directly to motherboard in most laptops

For PCIe (CPU → GPU/SSD):
	•	Slightly more latency
	•	But massive bulk transfer (e.g., “send this 500MB texture to GPU”)
	•	GPU itself has super-fast local VRAM once data arrives

    Alright — let’s get very, very clear and detailed about this:

⸻

⚡ First: Is the Memory Bus “better” than PCIe?

✅ Memory bus (CPU ↔ RAM)
✅ PCIe bus (CPU ↔ GPU, SSD, etc.)

They are both extremely fast, but:
	•	Memory bus is better at one thing → “constant feeding of massive amounts of tiny pieces of data quickly”.
	•	PCIe is better at something else → “high-speed communication between powerful components” like GPUs and SSDs, even if slightly slower than RAM.

⸻

📚 Deeper Explanation:

Feature	Memory Bus (DDR4/DDR5)	PCIe Bus
Speed (Latency)	🔥 Extremely low latency (nanoseconds)	⚡ A little higher latency (microseconds)
Bandwidth	🛣️ Wide, 64 bits per stick (plus multiples)	🛣️ Variable, 1x, 4x, 8x, 16x lanes (x16 = super fast)
Purpose	Fast access to small units of data	Moving large blocks of data between CPU and devices
Flexibility	Only CPU ↔ RAM	CPU ↔ GPU, SSDs, Network cards, etc.
Smartness	Simple read/write, some ECC	Advanced packet-based (error correction, retries)



⸻

🧠 So in short:
	•	Memory Bus is faster for tiny data, like small instructions and temporary results (think: brain RAM).
	•	PCIe Bus is optimized for big, bulk data movement like GPU images, SSD file transfers, network packets.

⸻

👀 Why Does GPU Feel So Fast Compared to CPU+RAM?

Because GPU is designed for massively parallel operations, not just because of buses.

Think about it like this:

Action	CPU (with RAM)	GPU (with VRAM via PCIe)
Math for every pixel	CPU does few tasks fast	GPU does thousands of tasks simultaneously
Bus Access	CPU ↔ RAM: Fetching lots of small data fast	GPU ↔ VRAM: Feeding pixel data super efficiently
End Result	Feels slower for huge visual tasks	Feels faster for rendering/update



⸻

✅ Your screen updates faster with the GPU because:
	•	The GPU does millions of tiny calculations in parallel (parallelization).
	•	The GPU has its own dedicated super-fast VRAM memory, connected internally, not through the normal RAM bus.
	•	CPU has to work with general-purpose RAM, which is fast but not tuned for thousands of simultaneous tasks.

⸻

🎯 Clear Picture:

For memory access (CPU → RAM):
	•	Super low latency
	•	Fast small reads/writes
	•	Not designed for moving huge graphics frames directly

For PCIe (CPU → GPU/SSD):
	•	Slightly more latency
	•	But massive bulk transfer (e.g., “send this 500MB texture to GPU”)
	•	GPU itself has super-fast local VRAM once data arrives

⸻

🌎 Why Not Use Memory Bus for Everything?

Because it’s tightly tied to the CPU.
You can’t have SSDs, Wi-Fi, GPUs fighting for a slot on the RAM highway — it would choke everything.

Memory Bus = Private VIP Lane for CPU.
PCIe = Shared 20-lane highway for big trucks (GPUs, SSDs, etc.) to join the system.

⸻

🧠 Final Analogy:

Imagine a City:
	•	🏎️ Memory Bus = Personal Ferrari for CPU → Only carries CPU’s tiny quick errands (tiny fast rides).
	•	🚚 PCIe Bus = Highway full of big trucks → Carries big cargo (like images, files) to and from GPU, SSD.
	•	✨ GPU = Own little city district with its own streets (VRAM) → Super fast for graphics and display work once the data is there.

⸻

📝 So, to answer you simply:

✅ Memory bus is “better” for tiny, fast, close work (CPU internal work).
✅ PCIe is “better” for big, heavy, external data movements (GPU, SSD, etc.).
✅ GPU feels fast because it has massive parallelism and its own super-fast memory (VRAM) — not because PCIe alone is faster.
