To sum it up again, PCI-e is a class of connector used in just about every computer out there. M.2 is a type of connector, too, but it’s also a form factor characterized by small, slim components that fit in space-constrained computers, laptops, and tablets. M.2 ports are mostly used for M.2 NVMe SSDs, the fastest storage media on the market, while PCI-e ports are used for a much wider range of components.

The popularity of M.2 NVMe SSDs makes it difficult to compare them to 2.5-inch PCI-e SSDs (there really aren’t many out there anymore), but it’s safe to say that you’ll want to look in the M.2 category if you’re in the market for a blazing-fast SSD.
